A game where you wander around in rockets, blasting asteroids with bullets.
(Thats all there is for now, more to come)



### Behind The Scene
I love making games in just plain HTML. This is one of my trials to make a fully polished game,that I will finish 'one day'.
I don't have any hard deadlines set out. The only aim is 'be plain' and build from scratch.
It is written mainly in javascript, using Canvas element for drawing.
